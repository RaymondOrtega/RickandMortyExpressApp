### lessons learned:
```
I stayed up all night working on this App but if i had the opportunity to do it again i would. there was just allot that i learned working though this project. It clarified allot of concepts that seemed very abstract to me. Working through client side versus sever side problems and being successful in the end is an amazing feeling.
